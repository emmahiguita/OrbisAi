# Stability Configuration File for Compose Compiler
# This file defines which classes should be treated as stable by the Compose Compiler

# Treat all classes in these packages as stable
# com.example.orbisai.data.models.**
# com.example.orbisai.domain.models.**

# Mark specific classes as stable
# com.example.orbisai.ui.theme.OrbisAITheme

# Mark classes with @Immutable or @Stable annotations
# These are automatically handled by the compiler, but can be explicitly listed here if needed

# Example: External library classes that should be considered stable
# kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow
# androidx.compose.runtime.State
